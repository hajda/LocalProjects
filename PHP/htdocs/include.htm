   <body>
   
      <?php include("menu.php"); ?>
      <p>This is an example to show how to include PHP file!</p>
      <p>I won't halt the execution just because menu.php is not found</p>
      <p>You can try wrong include by passing a non-existing filename to <b>include()</b> function. You will still see this text in that case.</p>
